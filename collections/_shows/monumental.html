  text: "Our vision for the Monuments Project is one of rigorous inquiry into our collective history, steadfast community engagement, and the undaunted effort to represent the vast multiplicity of American experiences in the country’s commemorative landscape. This series creates a necessary and expansive forum for exploring the stories inherent to this work, and we at Mellon are pleased PRX is sharing them with the broader public."

<p><a href="https://www.prx.org/monumental"><i>Monumental</i></a> — an original podcast from PRX, hosted by bestselling author Ashley C. Ford — considers the state of historical monuments across America. The podcast confronts what the US has celebrated and memorialized, exploring questions about the past and future. Inspired by findings from the Monument Lab in Philadelphia, PRX Productions assembled a team of journalists to learn what symbols are being challenged and remade in our public spaces, and to interrogate the political and personal costs. The 10-episode series garnered an exceptional 330,000 downloads in its first season, and stations in Wyoming and New Mexico and public radio program <i>Latino USA</i> broadcast episodes on air.</p>

<p>An initiative of PRX Productions supported by Mellon Foundation as part of the <a href="https://www.mellon.org/article/the-monuments-project-initiative">Monuments Project</a>, <i>Monumental</i> embodies PRX’s drive to craft podcasts that consciously consider who is at the center of the stories we tell and who are the people who are listening. PRX is thoughtful about how our work impacts the audio industry — we think about what the status quo is in public media and podcasting, and how we can remake it for the better to include a broader range of voices and producers.

<p><blockquote>As a mission-oriented organization, PRX is deeply committed to expanding public media to be representative of the full American public.</blockquote></p>

<p>With shows like <i>Monumental</i>, PRX provides audiences with well-made, consequential content that broadens our perspectives and deepens our empathy. We are proud to be an active part of the conversation shaping how we think about our society.</p>
