<p><a href="https://snapjudgment.org/"><em>Snap Judgment</em></a>, a quintessential show with a musical brand of storytelling, comes to the airwaves each week via PRX. Host Glynn Washington and producers draw in listeners with expert narrative and sound design. The teams behind the show shared insights into their pitch process and design in community workshops for the PRX Podcast Garage at KQED in San Francisco, giving fellow producers and fans a look behind the scenes and inspiration for telling their own stories.</p>

<p>PRX Podcast Garages are hubs where makers of all levels can gather together, learn new skills through workshops, and gain access to production resources like recording studios. They support creators like John Galante, who came to a recurring Garage workshop in Boston to explore ideas for a podcast. Galante went on to record episodes of <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/lacs/podc/?_gl=1*8gegc*_gcl_au*MTk4MDUyNjUzNi4xNzE5NTA3NTQ2*_ga*MTExNDE0ODE5Ni4xNzE5NTA3NTQ2*_ga_RE35PKQB7J*MTcxOTUwNzU0Ni4xLjEuMTcxOTUxMjY2Ni42MC4wLjA"><em>Crossing Fronteras</em></a> at the Garage, with the support of a producer he connected with through PRX resources. Helping facilitate this type of creator success is part of the driving ethos of the Podcast Garages. Over the past year, PRX Podcast Garages have hosted more than 45 workshops and events, reaching more than 1,500 people coast to coast.</p>

<blockquote><p>Through the Garages and other training opportunities, we connect this star-power talent from our community to support local ecosystems of independent creators, helping seed and grow new podcasts far beyond those we formally represent.</p></blockquote>
