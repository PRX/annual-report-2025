Thanks to our parents, starting as children we were exposed to world events. So The World is one of our favorite programs. When our father was Jimmy Carter’s Secretary of Defense, world events could be personally stomach churning. But now they are a welcome diversion from US domestic politics. The World presents a nonpartisan view of world affairs, including reports from correspondence and interviews with world leaders. Best of all the reports cover not just the top news, there are cultural vignettes on everything from Armenian winemakers to female Zambian rappers. The hosts, Marco Werman and Carolyn Beeler, wrap it all up and make the case that Americans must recognize our connection to the rest of the world."

<p><em><a href="http://theworld.org">The World</a></em> from PRX and GBH searches out new perspectives on the biggest international stories, while finding moments of joy that keep listeners connected across borders. This year, Carolyn Beeler joined Marco Werman as co-host, bringing her expertise as the show’s longtime environment correspondent and editor to the role. <i>The World</i> continued reporting initiatives to cover the intersection of <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/lifestyle-belief/religion/sacred-nation">religion and nationalism</a> around the globe, and brought listeners insights into <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/development-education/the-worlds-global-classroom">higher education</a> and how countries beyond the US pay for it.</p>

<p>In April, Marco and a team of <i>World</i> journalists spent a week bringing the program to listeners from Israel — they were on the ground during an incoming missile attack from Iran. Earlier, <i>The World</i>’s Shirin Jaafari accompanied the Jordanian air force on an aid drop over Gaza — a reporting effort that took weeks to arrange and was approved just hours before departure. Jaafari managed to cross the Iraq-Jordan border in time to board the early morning flight and describe a <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2024/03/27/view-over-gaza-onboard-jordanian-aid-plane">rare view</a> of the destruction in the Gaza Strip. Following the reverberating impacts of global conflict takes heavy investment in planning, preparation, and security training. Part of <i>The World</i>’s mandate is not just to cover what journalists refer to as “the bang-bang” — the daily exchange of hostilities — but also everyday life in war zones. </p>

<p><blockquote>This type of intrepid, in-depth international reporting bringing listeners closer to the headlines is part of <i>The World</i>’s trademark journalism.</blockquote></p>

<p>With correspondents on six continents and hosts on both coasts of the US, <i>The World</i> remains the premier nonprofit source for global news on public radio.</p>
