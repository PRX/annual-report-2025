<p><a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com"><em>Ear Hustle</em></a> is uniquely adept at telling expansive stories from confined spaces as the first podcast created and produced in prison. Starting from inside San Quentin State Prison in 2016, <em>Ear Hustle</em> also shares perspectives from the outside, post-incarceration. Episodes have been downloaded more than 81 million times, and incarcerated people in prisons around the world can listen to the podcast.</p>

<p><em>Ear Hustle</em> now also elevates stories from women’s perspectives at the California Institution for Women and the Central California Women’s Facility — the largest women’s prison in the world. In response to calls from educators, the team has started creating free and easily accessible curriculum guides — giving teachers resources to build empathy and understanding about mass incarceration in the United States.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Ear Hustle</em> provides a means of both expression and skills-building from both the inside and outside, and underscores the value of all its contributors.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Ear Hustle</em> celebrated its 100<sup>th</sup> episode this year with the show’s first-ever cross-country live tour. Later, the hosts shared the stage with other inspiring figures at the <a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/sessions/reimagining-a-justice-system-beyond-bars">Aspen Ideas Festival</a>. Its latest seasons have brought listeners stories about mothers and daughters, facing the end of life while incarcerated, and from the new producing team at the Media Lab inside the recently renamed San Quentin Rehabilitation Center. An episode featuring the first stories reported by the new inside-team members was named a finalist for the <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/ear-hustle-from-radiotopia-and-prx-named-a-finalist-in-the-2024-national-magazine-awards-d3c956b115c4">National Magazine Awards</a> — an achievement coveted by media professionals.</p>
