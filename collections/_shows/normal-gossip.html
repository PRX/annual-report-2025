  text: "I’ve been a fan of Radiotopia shows for the last decade. I remember listening to <i>The Allusionist</i> and <i>99% Invisible</i> and <i>The Kitchen Sisters</i> and <i>The Heart</i>. So it was really exciting for me [to get an offer from Radiotopia] because a lot of the conversations we had had with potential partners seemed very interested in the product that was the podcast — as opposed to the podcast being the product of production and creative work done in the medium of audio."

  text: "I love so many Radiotopia shows past and present — <em>Normal Gossip</em>, <em>The Memory Palace</em>, <em>Song Exploder</em>, <em>Articles of Interest</em>, <em>Everything Is Alive</em> … I believe in the mission of a collective of independent creators with full creative freedom. It’s so special and it’s how you have such unique shows, like <em>Everything Is Alive</em> and <em>Ear Hustle</em>, which might not have been greenlit at a place like SiriusXM because the commercial value is unclear. I love what you’re doing and I hope you know how much you’re loved."

<p>When <a href="https://defector.com/normal-gossip-podcast"><i>Normal Gossip</i></a> joined <a href="http://radiotopia.fm">Radiotopia</a> from PRX in 2023, the show sharing strange, funny, and utterly banal reader-submitted gossip was already a hit. Since joining the creator-owned network supported by PRX, the podcast — from the minds of Kelsey McKinney and Alex Sujong Laughlin — has exploded its reach, hitting more than 10 million downloads in the spring of 2023 and more than 20 million just a year later.</p>

<p>McKinney and Laughlin are part of <a href="http://Defector.com">Defector</a> media, a worker-owned sports and culture website dedicated to letting talent flourish — an ethos that mirrors Radiotopia’s mission to let creators own the work they produce and its derivatives. When an audio producer sells their show to a corporate media outlet, the fate of their work is out of their hands. Radiotopia offers an alternative for creators — letting them own their own intellectual property while benefiting from a network effect to leverage sponsorship and community with other stellar programs. Retaining IP rights means that creators aren’t at risk of their great idea ending if corporate shareholders and executives decide to go a different direction.</p>
<p><blockquote>In a tumultuous time for the industry, PRX is leading the way in supporting different types of business structures that keep power in the hands of creators.</blockquote></p>
