  text: "If you are an independent creator and you have stories that you and only you could tell, we are the place for you. Without PRX, you might have to change what you’re doing to conform to what’s popular or trendy, or take notes from people whose priority may not be creative excellence. We are stewards of independence in the audio ecosystem."

  text: "I’m so grateful to Radiotopia for their partnership. They’ve nurtured the growth of <em>Song Exploder</em>, and my own growth as an artist, with care and compassion. They’ve made connections on my behalf, like this year’s new venture with the BBC. It’s very special to be an independent creator who also has the consistent support of an institution, through thick and thin."

<p>Created and hosted by Hrishikesh Hirway, <a href="https://songexploder.net/"><em>Song Exploder</em></a> is a podcast where musicians take apart their songs and tell the story of how they were made. The show, a long-time member of <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia from PRX</a>, entered its 10th year crossing new terrain with standout episodes featuring musicians like Shania Twain, Rhiannon Giddens, Green Day, and Sam Smith, and a special partnership with The Toronto Symphony Orchestra to dissect one of the most famous modern classical compositions, Igor Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring,” in front of a live audience. <em>Song Exploder</em> has also expanded into the UK as part of a new PRX partnership with the BBC, and is now available in the on-demand app BBC Sounds and broadcast across BBC 6 Music. PRX’s <em>Ear Hustle</em> and <em>The Science of Everything</em> can be heard on BBC Sounds, too.</p>

<blockquote><p>This year, Radiotopia also celebrated its 10th anniversary as a creator-led network.</p></blockquote>

<p>With Radiotopia, producers have the power to make decisions that take their work in new directions. Acclaimed podcasts like <em>Weight For It</em>, new to the network, and trailblazers like <em>The Kitchen Sisters Present</em> and <em>Radio Diaries</em>, which have been at the forefront of audio predating podcasting, are proof positive of Radiotopia’s aspirations and mission to support incredible, independent talent.</p>

<p>As the podcasting landscape has gotten more crowded, it’s become harder to compete for the resources supporting independent, creator-owned work — listener support has become an evermore crucial part of the equation. A decade on, Radiotopia remains synonymous with premium content and collaborative partnership that helps our network shows standout in a crowded marketplace.</p>
