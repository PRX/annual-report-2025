  text: "Constructing a podcast is akin to building an intricate puzzle. Each season begins with a central theme serving as the puzzle’s border. The smaller themes form interior pieces — each becoming an episode that fits into the larger picture. Finally, the format, the time, the structure — these are the details that give our puzzle its depth and texture."

<p><a href="https://pod.link/1708662302"><i>Second Sunday</i></a> — a podcast from The Qube about Black queer people finding, keeping, and sometimes losing faith in the Black church — navigates religion, spirituality, culture, and identity. It’s one of four shows that are part of PRX’s Big Questions Project, supported by the John Templeton Foundation, helping deep thinkers bring their perspectives to podcasting. This year, <i>Second Sunday</i>, <a href="https://pod.link/1703257857"><i>Rock That Doesn’t Roll</i></a>, <a href="https://pod.link/1708625744"><i>Moral Repair</i></a>, and <a href="https://pod.link/1707389845"><i>Mother is a Question</i></a> launched their second seasons with guidance from PRX Productions. The shows, which all probe central questions of what it means to be human, garnered waves of recognition in their first seasons, including from The Ambie Awards For Excellence in Audio, the Religion Communicators Council, and the American Academy of Religion.</p>

<p>Initiatives like the Big Questions Project partner exceptional thinkers with PRX’s production team to launch new, complex podcasts in a highly competitive landscape. PRX offers guidance, poses questions to strengthen concepts, and builds systems to support sustainable podcast production processes. We also bring in industry leaders for dynamic exchanges to share expertise with creators and help hone their audio-making skills.</p>

<p>In every show we support, the ultimate decision-makers are the hosts and creators themselves.

<blockquote><p>Creators can lean on the technical prowess of the PRX Productions studio to ensure that their ideas come to life with a quality of content that competes with the top shows in the podcast marketplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>This collaborative approach ensures that the shows remain authentic to their vision and resonate with their target audiences, while maintaining the highest caliber of audio production.</p>
