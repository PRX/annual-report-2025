<p>How do you make the perfect grilled cheese? Tomato soup? Iceberg salad? For home cooks who prep meals with podcasts in their ears, <a href="https://www.therecipepodcast.com/"><em>The Recipe with Kenji and Deb</em></a> is the ideal kitchen companion. Co-hosts and co-creators Deb Perelman (<em>Smitten Kitchen</em>) and J. Kenji López-Alt (<em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Food Lab</em>, <em>The Wok</em>) help home cooks become even better with a fun, light-hearted show from Radiotopia from PRX.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Recipe with Kenji and Deb</em> is the first original podcast from <a href="https://prx.org/productions">PRX Productions</a>, our in-house audio production unit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Working with top-tier talent — new to podcasting, but already renowned in their field — PRX helped conceive, produce, distribute, market, and support <em>The Recipe</em> from its inception. The show debuted at #1 on Apple Podcasts – Arts and had more than half a million downloads in its first six months.</p>

<p>Today, PRX Productions makes shows that consistently top charts and best-of lists, but more important than quantitative metrics is the quality of our output. PRX Productions has evolved from creating bespoke audio content for partners, to leading original content creation like <em>The Recipe</em>. This sustainable growth over the past several years has set us up as a model for other audio organizations, and has helped PRX diversify our revenue streams in a turbulent podcasting landscape. With PRX Productions as a marquee service, there is more opportunity than ever for PRX to say “yes” to leading the way for exceptional audio experiences.</p>
