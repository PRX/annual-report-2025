<p>Hosted by award-winning journalist David Green, <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/left-right-center"><i>Left, Right &amp; Center</i></a> is a weekly politics show that takes political debate back to civil discussion. Born at KCRW — Southern California’s public radio station — PRX now distributes the show to stations nationwide.</p>

<blockquote><p>PRX was the only public media network to launch broadcast shows nationally in this year.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to <i>Left, Right &amp; Center</i>, we brought to market: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast"><i>The Ezra Klein Show</i></a> from <i>New York Times Opinion</i>, a series of conversations on topics that matter; <a href="https://www.nosmallendeavor.com/"><i>No Small Endeavor</i></a> from Tokens Media in Nashville, which explores what it means to lead a good life; and <a href="https://www.wunc.org/show/embodied"><i>Embodied</i></a> from WUNC in North Carolina, which jumps into taboo personal topics including sex, relationships, and health. The portfolio we distribute to local radio stations gives these shows access to nationwide audiences through <a href="https://www.prx.org/stations">PRX Station Services</a>, and helps stations expand their listenership.</p>

<p>PRX is a nimble leader in public media, capable of pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in audio through our curated programming and digital infrastructure. We facilitate an exchange of audio-based ideas, opening up a world of content for program managers at local public radio stations to air. This means compelling shows like <i>Embodied</i> and <i>Left, Right &amp; Center</i> can break out beyond their local reach in North Carolina and California, and podcast-first programs can be heard on the airwaves nationally. In bringing new, often unexpected, shows to market, PRX helps solve a gap in experimentation in radio. While other networks might not feel the need to take risks in the audio space, PRX believes in the change and growth that feeds creativity in the system — and diversifies the type of content people around the country can hear by tuning to their local station.</p>
