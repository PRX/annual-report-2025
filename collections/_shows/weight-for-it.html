I am confident that when we look back on the journey of our show, we’ll point to those three days as a turning point, where we transitioned from determined enthusiasts into professionals equipped with the industry knowledge and connections we need to be really successful."

  text: "I wasn’t sure if I should continue because of my lack of audience engagement and following, but I now have perspective on how to actually identify my audience, gain perspective, create a better logo, create a better social presence, extend myself beyond Youtube and my platform (creating a 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> life for my show), and I also made friends with similar aspirations, which wasn’t something I had before last Wednesday."

<p>In <em><a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/weight-for-it">Weight For It</a></em>, a podcast from PRX’s Radiotopia, host Ronald Young Jr. unpacks the nuanced thoughts of fat folks, and of folks who think about their weight all the time. A Tribeca Official Selection in 2023, <em>Weight For It</em> has received some of the top accolades of the industry, including <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/weight-for-it-and-embodied-awarded-by-the-the-podcast-academy-in-the-2024-ambies-f115aa8d7933">winning three Ambie Awards</a>.</p>

<p>Young is the archetypal independent producer and was one of many industry leaders sharing insights at PRX’s Podcast Creator Summit this summer. PRX convened two multi-day gatherings in partnership with WAMU in Washington, DC, and WABE in Atlanta, Georgia. The summits, launched in the spirit of the PRX Podcast Garages, were designed for podcasters seeking to build supportive creative communities. Free to creators of all levels, the summits centered on seminars, training, and networking opportunities, offering support in the art, business, and production of audio.</p>

<blockquote><p>Activating these types of spaces for audio creators and storytellers is a way to support and inspire burgeoning podcast ecosystems in creative “bright spots.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When podcasting began, its low barrier to entry allowed new ideas to flourish. As the industry has grown more commercialized, independent creators find themselves pushed to the margins. Decentralizing professional organizations, keeping podcasting accessible to all artists, and serving as a launching point for new ideas and connections is part of our driving mission as a nonprofit. PRX believes in supporting creator independence with the knowledge, confidence, and community that the Podcast Garages and in-person summits can build.</p>
