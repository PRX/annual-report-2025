intro: "<p>PRX brings radio listeners some of the best examples of public media storytelling, from the thoughtful perspectives of <a href='http://www.theworld.org'><i>The World</i>’s international journalism</a>, to the definitional sound of <a href='https://www.thisamericanlife.org/'><i>This American Life</i></a> — which was celebrated at <a href='https://medium.com/prxofficial/2025-tribeca-festival-announces-this-american-life-and-the-memory-palace-live-events-1aaedf67e44f'>Tribeca Festival</a> in June for decades of audio excellence. Just this year, investigative reporting from <a href='https://revealnews.org/'><i>Reveal</i></a> was a winner in the Healthcare Journalism Awards, DuPont-Columbia Awards, Edward R. Murrow Awards, National Magazine Awards, and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. And, PRX has distributed half of the winners of the Pulitzers for audio reporting. The PRX roster is beloved and foundational. We are also expanding its sound to meet the future of public radio.</p>"
quotes:
  - text: "<p>Can we make public media and the public media sensibility a little edgier and a little bit more contemporary and a little bit more in tune with the zeitgeist? And so, what, what do millennials as a generation want then? What do Gen Z as a generation want? Not what do age groups want? What do generations as cultural markers want? The future of public media doesn't have to sound exactly the same. It needs to uphold the same values, but it doesn't have to sound the same.</p>"

PRX’s broadcast reach hit a milestone of 5.3 million listeners this year. We curate a broadcast portfolio that is responsive to audience and station needs, including programming that welcomes new generations of listeners. Offerings like KCRW’s _[The Sam Sanders Show](https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-sam-sanders-show)_ — one of the fastest-growing programs in the PRX portfolio — respond to a desire for content with sensibilities more attuned to the lighter side of life and serve as an antidote to news fatigue without losing public media values.
