intro: "<p>Radiotopia from PRX is a cultural tastemaker, evolving from public radio roots into visionary storytellers that represent the best of their genres across history, fiction, society and culture. This year, Radiotopia launched 17 seasons and specials, including bringing on Hyperfixed from Alex Goldman, Proxy with Yowei Shaw, Never Post, and Radiotopia Presents: Red for Revolution, a limited series audio drama centering intergenerational stories of Black women and queer love set in the 1970s. With support from the Mellon Foundation, Ear Hustle built an audio production space in the California Institution for Women, where the training program will feature collaboration with KALW public radio’s Uncuffed. Radiotopia Presents: We're Doing the Wiz and The Memory Palace were featured at Tribeca Festival. And Normal Gossip’s creators passed the reins of the hit show to new host Rachelle Hampton and producer Se’era Spragley Ricks.</p>"

  text: "“Audio storytelling — that style of storytelling — it started in public media and it feels like we're, like, a couple of generations beyond it, like in terms of like the lineage. It's kind of like when you put cheese on broccoli, we are sharing educational information, but we're making it, like, really fun and entertaining and I think engaging people to consume content that is still, like, high quality but also very fun.”"

Radiotopia shows are art in audio format. When creators come to Radiotopia, it’s because they have a spark — a passion that has potential to ignite the culture or resonate with a handful of listeners. We treat our listeners as the smart, intelligent audience they are. As AI-generated slop swarms feeds, the basic human need to tell stories and build personal connections faces existential threat in a commercial marketplace. Radiotopia is a bulwark for audio artists in an uncertain future.

Creators have the freedom to explore and take risks with the backing of a cooperative that can hold space for new sound. We treat all of the creators who come to us with sincerity and care because these are their careers and they are entrusting us with some of their most personal stories. There are real business benefits to being in Radiotopia, but it’s also a stance on life — promoting community and collective action to lift each other up.
