  - text: "<i>Ear Hustle</i> changes the world one story, one episode, one listener, and one podcaster at a time. I've been listening to <i>Ear Hustle</i> since its inception, and it has fundamentally altered — in wonderful ways — the way I'm able to engage with my community. <i>Ear Hustle</i> invites me to see and feel the experience of incarcerated people through eyes that are honest, questioning, and — most importantly and beautifully — human, this is why I support <i>Ear Hustle</i>."

It's an example of what we can accomplish when we work together and pool our resources and have each other's back.”"

Radiotopia shows are art in audio format. When creators come to Radiotopia, it’s because they have a spark — a passion that has potential to ignite the culture. We treat our listeners as the smart, intelligent audience they are. As AI-generated slop swarms platforms, the human need to tell stories and build personal connections faces existential threat in a commercial marketplace. Radiotopia is a bulwark for audio artists in an uncertain future.

Creators have the freedom to explore and take risks with the backing of a public media institution that holds space for new sound. There are real business benefits to being in Radiotopia, but it’s also a stance on life — promoting community and collective action to lift each other up.
