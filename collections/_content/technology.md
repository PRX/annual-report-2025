intro: "<p>This year marked a pivotal moment for PRX’s Dovetail platform, evolving from a tool for close partners into a comprehensive platform capable of serving public media makers nationwide. Dovetail — a digital platform that allows everyone from individual creators to public radio stations to manage, monetize, and monitor metrics on their podcasts — is becoming the foundational digital audio infrastructure for media in the public interest.</p><p>Technology built by PRX is fundamentally different from the products commercial companies offer. Commercial platforms extract maximum revenue for themselves, but our explicit goal is to build sustainability, growth, and genuine support for the creators and stations that depend on us — while ensuring that our listeners are maximally protected with privacy-centric advertising. This means developing networks that serve the system rather than exploit it, and creating opportunities for cross-promotion that helps our entire community thrive.</p>"

  text: "“We, by being a nonprofit, have the ability to say, actually we wanna draw a different line based on our values. Our goal is to pass money back to the producers and the system and actually keep as thin kind of budget of things as we can. That is an alignment of interests that because of being a nonprofit in the public media space and our very, you know, well-declared mission around that. We're all on the same side within public media in a way that no other company that's building a platform for this can say that.”"

And the simple answer to that is, for over 10 years, we've delivered at this point billions of downloads to people including some of the biggest shows ever, like Serial, that have been on the Dovetail platform. We have an incredible success rate, an incredible record that we can point to. You can both trust that we have your best interests at heart, and you can also trust that we know what we're doing and we're very more than competent at podcasting and have proven that with a long track record.”"

*PRX has delivered billions of downloads to audiences worldwide.* Stations depend on PRX because we've built our reputation through consistent service and unwavering principles. In an industry where platforms can disappear overnight or change direction without warning, *PRX offers something increasingly rare: stability rooted in mission, not market whims.*
