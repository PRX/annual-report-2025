<p>In January, Stephanie Kuo began her role as Vice President of Content at PRX, previously serving as the director of PRX’s content development and training initiatives. Recognized as a <a href="https://current.org/35-rising-stars-making-their-mark-in-public-media/stephanie-kuo/">Rising Star</a> by industry publication <i>Current</i>, Stephanie brings a keen sense of mission, innovation, and future-forward vision for PRX and our content partners in her new role leading PRX’s growing portfolio.</p>

<p>Partners working with PRX know the value of a portfolio that considers not just entertainment, but strong mission alignment.</p>

<p><blockquote>“PRX is the preeminent trusted nonprofit partner in podcasting,” Stephanie says. “People come to us because of that trust, because of that legacy.”</blockquote></p>

<p>Curating a portfolio that balances PRX’s content mission with commercial viability, Stephanie works to support programming that gives a wide range of listeners opportunities to make sense of the world around them. With roots in public radio, part of her focus is on the foundational public media ethos of making content that fosters empathy, engagement, and activation — and expanding what that means for the future of listening.</p>

<blockquote><p>“While there are some universal truths, the bounds of the media landscape are shifting,” she says. “And it feels like our duty as a legacy disrupter and innovator to be at the forefront of new solutions and systems-level change. I’m excited that my new role empowers me to be at the helm of these efforts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Expanding PRX’s commitment to accessibility and supporting independent creators is foundational to Stephanie’s vision for content. Above all, PRX is a place where creators are valued — we are passionable about fostering a creative environment that prioritizes the well-being of the storytellers we work with as essential to the health of our industry.</p>
