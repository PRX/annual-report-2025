  text: "The very first podcast I ever listened to was <i>The West Wing Weekly</i>. It not only allowed me to revisit the world of an America that inspires me to service, it also led to meeting a new group of friends who have brought much joy into my life. <i>The West Wing Weekly</i> introduced me to several other PRX podcasts, including and especially <i>Ear Hustle</i>. This podcast opened my eyes to what life is like for incarcerated persons and expanded my horizons with regard to the community of people who work in and are served by our prison systems. PRX makes the world a better place one story at a time. For this reason, I am proud to include them in my estate plan."
