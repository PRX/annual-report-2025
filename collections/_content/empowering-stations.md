intro: "<p>PRX offers support for our network of close to 900 local stations across the U.S. We distribute a cost-accessible <a href='https://prx.org/shows'>broadcast portfolio</a> of defining shows in public radio like <a href='https://themoth.org/'><i>The Moth</i></a> and <a href='https://www.latinousa.org/'><i>Latino USA</i></a>. As under-resourced stations face headwinds after federal funding cuts, we provide free access to <a href='https://www.prx.mx/'>PRX Remix</a>, a 24/7 stream of high-quality independent stories. PRX also offers personalized services that help stations explore podcasting possibilities, brainstorm solutions to their <a href='https://prx.org/technology'>technology needs</a>, or share their content and find new, unique programming on PRX Networks or the Exchange — public radio's largest distribution marketplace.</p>"
quotes:
  - text: "<p>To me, it seems like the tone and the tenor of the conversations we have with stations — it seems to be, like, finding new ways to partner with stations and understanding, like, what they're trying to do. And, we have a lot of things we can offer. We can talk about programming, we can talk about helping them get their local content on the Exchange, which they can do for free. If they're trying to make moves in podcasting, we can connect them. We can set up a demo of Dovetail. Or we can just even set up just a conversation to, to learn about their podcasting journey and ask and answer questions they may have about the medium. With a lot of these stations, I'm not always coming at them with programming. Our conversations are multidimensional and it's always about a real, a true partnership.</p>"

  - text: "<p>Working with the team at PRX has been a true highlight for us at WUSF. It's more than just a partnership; it's a genuine collaboration built on a shared vision. From the initial training offered in a Design Thinking workshop to the hands-on help with launching our first video podcast, PRX has consistently shown up as a supportive and forward-thinking partner. They were also there to help us make our Pop-up Podcast Garage a reality, which brought our community together in a new and exciting way. We deeply value this relationship and look forward to what we'll build together next.</p>"

This year, with the support of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, PRX brought a cohort of 30 public media stations onto PRX’s podcast publishing platform, [Dovetail](https://medium.com/prxofficial/what-is-dovetail-from-prx-e2d1b7f79c3), for no cost, effectively lowering the barrier to entry for stations to [pivot to digital audio](https://medium.com/prxofficial/cpb-continues-to-advance-innovation-for-the-public-media-system-through-grant-to-prx-e6d1c35029b7). Instead of leaving stations to the whims of disparate and expensive commercial platforms, PRX technology seamlessly integrates with the needs unique to these outlets. Participating stations received ongoing learning sessions, consultation on their digital strategies, and tools that transform how they connect with their communities — while bringing on new revenue streams, workflow efficiencies, and station-to-station collaborations. It's technology built by public media, for public media, helping producers build new audiences and stay sustainable in an increasingly competitive landscape.
