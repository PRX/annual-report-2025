intro: "<p>In a year when many organizations retreated from equity work under external pressures, PRX made a different choice. We continue to lean into the values that underscore the best aspirations of public media — to reflect the full American public. PRX is a champion of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA) efforts in public media across the country — supporting a cohort of equity professionals in the industry. With PRX leadership, IDEA practitioners are sharing expertise, resources, and moral support, while leveraging their collective knowledge to strengthen equity work nationwide. </p>"
quotes:
  - text: "“I think one of the things I'm super proud of is PRX's posture towards the conversation about DEI. We are still committed to our IDEA pursuits and we want to lean in. Like, we're going to continue to forge on boldly saying that we still believe in inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility very loudly.”"

Beyond the public media system, PRX is supporting institutions resisting misinformation campaigns and efforts to undermine academic integrity. In May, PRX collaborated with Emory University on their inaugural [Public Scholarship Academy](https://publicscholarship.emory.edu/academy/), (and later, with Johns Hopkins University). We developed and facilitated curricula to introduce fellows to the podcast industry and translate academic expertise into podcast settings. PRX has long been a strong advocate of higher learning — our portfolio is home to podcasts that engage the pursuit of knowledge and social impact at the university level and beyond. Helping advance values of truth and diversity within and beyond the system is key to how PRX shows up in partnerships.
