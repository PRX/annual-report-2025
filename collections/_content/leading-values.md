intro: "<p>In a year when many organizations retreated from equity work under external pressures, PRX made a different choice. We continue to lean into the values that underscore the best aspirations of public media — to reflect the full American public. PRX is a pillar for Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA) efforts in public media across the country — supporting a cohort of professionals who often find themselves as the only person focused on equity work in their organizations. With PRX leadership, these practitioners are sharing expertise, resources, and moral support, leveraging their collective knowledge to strengthen equity work nationwide.</p>"

  text: "“I think one of the things I'm super proud of is PRX's posture towards the conversation about DEI. We are still committed to our IDEA pursuits and we want to lean in. Like, we're going to continue to forge on boldly saying that we still believe in inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility very loudly.”"

The challenges facing IDEA efforts in the media space are real and multifaceted. This work isn't about diversity metrics — it's about ensuring that public media truly serves all the communities it claims to represent. This is key to how PRX shows up in partnerships across the public media ecosystem — from content creation to stations services to technology platforms — especially as avenues for supporting this work narrow.
