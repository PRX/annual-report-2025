Your gift helps PRX support local public radio stations across the country. The elimination of federal funding for public media, including the sunsetting of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, has left many stations — especially rural and small community outlets — on the brink of deep cuts or closure. The system is still tied to costly, aging satellite technology, even as audiences demand news and entertainment that is on-demand, multilingual, and interactive. PRX works with small-town and metropolitan stations alike to navigate the turn to a digital landscape and grow audiences. When stations thrive, communities have access to trusted local journalism and programming.
