intro: "<p>Facilitating the success of creators not only within, but also beyond, our direct portfolio underpins our commitment to media in the public interest. In November, PRX supported a <a href='https://www.wusf.org/podcast-garage-2024'>Pop-up Podcast Garage at WUSF</a> in Sarasota, FL, connecting community talent and station representatives to share knowledge and build sustainable relationships. At <a href='https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-podcast-creator-summits-in-atlanta-georgia-and-austin-texas-in-photos-c3fab21c0268'>Podcast Creator Summits</a> hosted by PRX with our partners KUT and KUTX in Austin, TX, and later, WABE in Atlanta, GA, we brought together hundreds of local audio makers to take the pulse of the local creator industry and participate in panels and workshops to take their craft to the next echelon.</p>"
quotes:
  - text: "<p>I'm Gabe Wardell and I participated in the Podcaster Maker Summit. It was really a terrific opportunity and a terrific event. And the reason something like this is important is because independent makers need opportunities to really hone their skills and learn how to make quality content over time, right? What's happening right now is the barrier to entry for podcasting is super low, but the barrier to quality depends on people learning the processes and learning how to do it right. So I went into this event and I learned so much, and they led me through this amazing process that by the end of it, I had to reevaluate all the ideas I had going in. But now I know that I'm ready to deliver something of high quality that is built to last.</p>"

  - text: "<p>The reality is if there were no independent creators or there were no creators, there would be no companies, there would be nothing that companies could do anything with, right? I don't want independent creators to look to companies or PRX, solely as the arbiters of taste and of the rules. Like, it's just such a wild west ecosystem that, I think that we can certainly be tent poles in the industry, but what I want most is for independent creators to know that other independent creators exist and that their biggest resource isn't that they get to talk to me, it's that they get to talk to each other. I want creators to know that the skills, the success, and the keys to success exist amongst themselves, and that we don't, and we can't be there for them all the time, but that we can certainly launch them in the right directions.</p>"

In past years, the podcasting industry has swung toward blockbuster names, big money, and mass reach. But audiences are increasingly telling creators they need content that feels authentic, personal, and intimate again — and that they will support meaningful work. This is a pendulum swing back toward the values that have always defined the media for which we stand. PRX helps facilitate the success of the creators that are doing this work — without being prescriptive or presumptuous.
