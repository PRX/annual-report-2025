intro: "<p>This year brought sobering changes in how public media is supported across the system. Loss of funding and directional shifts in the industry are blows to mission-driven efforts to make media that serves the public interest. This turbulent landscape impacts PRX, but our work to find new paths forward continues with the type of strategic innovation PRX was created to pursue more than two decades ago when we championed a digital path forward for public media.</p>"

  text: "“We have to get to a place at some point, where mission-driven work is supported in this country. Otherwise it's going to be a very boring environment, and arts and culture will suffer as a result. So I think we have to be strong and continue to be agile in trying to bring new stuff to the fore and try to be the best partners in doing so.”"

Today, that work extends to more than providing products and programming, but work in service of and in collaboration with stations, creators, and supporters.

PRX operates as the bridge between what public media is today and what it can become—a dynamic, responsive organization that amplifies voices, strengthens communities, and safeguards the democratic mission of media in the public interest.
