<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p><b>For two decades, PRX has been a driving force of innovation in public media.</b> We’ve built digital-first audio infrastructure, elevated diverse and essential stories, and provided programming that connects with local audiences nationwide. This year — as we faced the most significant challenge to the U.S. public media system in more than 60 years — our work has never felt more urgent or more necessary.</p>
<p><b>PRX exists to serve both creators and listeners alike</b> to make public media stronger, more inclusive, and more sustainable. As federal funding was revoked and commercial pressures intensified, your support enabled us to move forward rather than retreat. We invested in new shows when others hesitated. We provided free services to under-resourced stations. We brought 30 public media stations onto our Dovetail podcast publishing and monetization platform at no cost. We held firm in our commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility, ensuring that the future of public media remains vibrant, representative, and strong.</p>
<p><b>PRX is not just weathering this storm — we're charting the course forward.</b> In the coming year, PRX will expand Dovetail even further, unlocking revenue for stations and creators.  We're accelerating the transition towards a digital-first infrastructure for a vibrant public media.</p>
<p>We’ll launch and support new shows from diverse creators whose stories reflect today’s audiences, reinforce Radiotopia as a cultural tastemaker that nurtures bold, independent talent, and grow our creative arm PRX Productions into emerging formats like video and live events. And we’ll continue providing direct support and training to rural and small-market stations most at risk of closure — strengthening peer learning networks that connect stations and creators across the country.</p>
<p><b>This transformation is only possible with visionary partners like you.</b> Your investment in PRX bolsters the infrastructure that safeguards public media's independence, champions producers who strengthen our civic life, and ensures stations remain vital sources of community connection.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, I’m filled with gratitude — for our dedicated staff, for our fearless creators, for our partner stations, and for you. Together, we’re not just protecting the future of public media — we’re reinventing it. Thank you for standing with PRX and for believing in the power of trusted voices to inform, inspire, and connect us all.</p>
