<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>In a year when trustworthy media has never been more needed, your support of PRX has helped protect and expand a vital space where authentic storytelling flourishes. Today, I’m excited to share our 2024 Annual Report and celebrate the impact we’ve achieved together. Core to PRX are the shows and creators we elevate to bring listeners the best of audio. Please take some time to scroll through the fiscal year’s highlights below, then bring the stories with you with a curated playlist of some of our favorite episodes.</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2024, PRX’s reach extended to virtually every corner of America.</p></blockquote>

<p>We served as a backbone for public radio, providing high-quality programming at subsidized rates to stations large and small. We championed intrepid, in-depth journalism through shows like <em>The World</em>, <em>Left, Right &amp; Center</em>, and <em>Reveal</em> that challenge our perceptions and encourage our empathy. We advanced our technology platforms to protect listener privacy, while ensuring creator success. And we uplifted emerging voices, supporting their artistic, technical, and professional success — some of which is reflected in the prodigious awards PRX programming has received this year.</p>

<p>For two decades, PRX has been at the forefront of change in the audio industry — building the technology and community-centered infrastructure that enables and supports the people making the most engaging, poignant, and innovative audio available.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since our founding, PRX has put more than $140 million directly into the hands of thousands of creators, allowing them to make the audio that drives their passion and never dictating the content they produce.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fundamentally, PRX believes in innovation in service of the public good. In an era where commercial media increasingly chases clicks over substance, your support has allowed PRX to take a different path. We’ve maintained our commitment to supporting creative risks in storytelling, expanding access to diverse voices and perspectives, and developing technology that provides paywall-free access to public information and podcast innovation.</p>

<p>As we enter 2025, we know the media landscape will continue to face extraordinary challenges. Commercial pressures threaten journalistic independence, while digital giants reshape how stories reach audiences. But with supporters like you, PRX continues to carve out protected space where meaningful storytelling can thrive.</p>

<p>Your continued partnership makes this work possible. Every dollar you have invested this year supports our mission to ensure that public media remains vibrant, diverse, and accessible to all.</p>

<p>With gratitude,</p>
