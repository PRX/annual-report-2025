# Web Component

Sometimes you want to do something that requires a NPM package. This environment allows for more complex component builds that can still be used in the Jekyll ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Make sure node dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn
```

To start building a new web component we first need to generate the files:

```bash
yarn generate prx-new-component-name
```

Now we can start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start a development server and open it in a browser window. You won't see your component, however. It has to be added to the `src/index.html` file. Add it to the page as you need to preview your work, but try to preserve the previews of existing components.

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, make sure to use the `prx-` prefix so the components won't conflict with other libraries' components.

## Using this component

Using the web components is as simple as adding the element to your HTML markup.

```html
<prx-new-component-name></prx-new-component-name>
```

You are ready to go. All scripts needed to detect and lazy load components in the page are already wired up in the `head.html`.
